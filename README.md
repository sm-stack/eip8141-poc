A reference implementation for [EIP-8141](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8141) (Frame Transactions), demonstrating native account abstraction on Ethereum with a modified geth client and Solidity compiler.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- CMake 3.13+
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh)
- Node.js 18+ (for E2E tests)

## Build

Build the modified geth and solc from submodules:

```bash
make build
```

This will:
1. Pull git submodules (`8141-geth`, `solidity-eip8141`)
2. Build geth → `build/bin/geth`
3. Build solc → `build/bin/solc`

You can also build individually:

```bash
make build-geth
make build-solc
```

## Contracts

Build and test the Solidity contracts (requires `build/bin/solc`):

```bash
make contracts   # forge build
make test        # forge test -vv
```

## Devnet

Start a local dev node with EIP-8141 support:

```bash
make devnet        # starts geth --dev on port 18545
make devnet-stop   # stops the dev node
```

## E2E Tests

E2E tests run against the local devnet. Start the devnet first, then:

```bash
make e2e                   # run all E2E tests
make e2e-simple            # Simple8141Account basic flow
make e2e-kernel            # Kernel8141 basic flow
make e2e-kernel-validator  # Kernel8141 validator swap
make e2e-hooked            # SpendingLimitHook
make e2e-coinbase-ecdsa    # CoinbaseSmartWallet ECDSA
make e2e-coinbase-webauthn # CoinbaseSmartWallet WebAuthn
make e2e-light-account     # LightAccount ECDSA
make benchmark             # Gas benchmarks
```

## Gas Benchmark

EIP-8141 frame transactions achieve significant gas savings compared to ERC-4337 UserOperations by eliminating the application-layer EntryPoint overhead. Validation and execution happen as native protocol operations (VERIFY/SENDER frames) rather than nested contract calls.

Run `make benchmark` against the local devnet to reproduce:

| Account | Operation | Total Gas | Verify | Sender |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Simple8141 | ETH transfer | 33,005 | 5,854 | 9,803 |
| Simple8141 | ERC20 transfer | 56,772 | 5,854 | 32,814 |
| Kernel8141 | ETH transfer | 49,943 | 20,677 | 11,486 |
| Kernel8141 | ERC20 transfer | 73,445 | 20,677 | 34,384 |
| Coinbase | ETH transfer | 46,253 | 17,316 | 10,869 |
| Coinbase | ERC20 transfer | 70,130 | 17,316 | 34,002 |
| LightAccount | ETH transfer | 39,539 | 11,506 | 10,405 |
| LightAccount | ERC20 transfer | 63,425 | 11,506 | 33,535 |

> These numbers include first-time costs: account creation for the ETH recipient (G_newaccount = 25,000 gas) and zero-to-non-zero SSTORE for the ERC20 recipient balance (20,000 gas). In steady-state (sending to existing accounts with non-zero balances), total gas is roughly **~25,000 lower for ETH** and **~17,000 lower for ERC20** transfers. Each account uses a separate recipient address to ensure fair comparison regardless of benchmark execution order.
